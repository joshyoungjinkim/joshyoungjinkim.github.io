                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I am an electrical engineering graduate at the University of Waterloo.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was born in Korea in 1995. In 2003, my family and I moved to Tokyo, Japan due to my father's work.
                <p>After living in Japan for nearly 3 years, I moved to Coquitlam, BC with my mother in 2006.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>In 2019, I graduated UWaterloo with an electrical engineering degree with management sciences option.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>My hobby includes travelling, recording and producing music (predominantly hip-hop and R&B)!
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>This website is an ongoing personal project and it is still quite new. I'm planning to add more contents and features!
